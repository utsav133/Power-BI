Steps Involved In the Project :-

# Data Collection and Preprocessing: 
Collected the raw data from the Company's database and preprocess it using Python. Data cleaning and feature engineering techniques applied to ensure the data is in the desired format for analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Conducted EDA on the preprocessed data using Python. This step includes performing statistical analysis, creating visualizations, and identifying patterns and trends in the data.

# Export Data to Power BI: 
Exported the preprocessed data and the results of the EDA and modeling steps to Power BI using a suitable file format CSV.

# Create the Dashboard: 
In Power BI, created a new report and added visualizations such as tables, charts, and graphs to represent the analyzed data. Used Power BI's drag-and-drop interface to create a dashboard that effectively communicates the insights you have gained from the analysis.

# Publish and Share the Dashboard: 
Once the dashboard is completed, published it to the Power BI service. Users can access the report through the Power BI app or web portal.

This project helped me to learn new features of Power BI.

# Dashboard
Created an energy consumption Power BI dashboard to provide a comprehensive overview of energy usage across different systems and devices. The dashboard utilized advanced data visualization techniques to highlight trends, anomalies and opportunities for energy conservation. Key features included interactive charts, drill-down capabilities, and data filtering options. The dashboard was designed to enable end-users to monitor and manage energy consumption efficiently, optimize energy efficiency, and reduce costs. The dashboard was praised for its user-friendly interface, high level of detail, and actionable insights, resulting in a measurable reduction in energy consumption and significant cost savings.
