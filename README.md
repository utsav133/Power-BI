## 👋 About the Project

This Power BI dashboard was built to explore and analyze energy consumption patterns across different systems and time frames. The goal was to create a visually insightful and interactive report to understand where and how energy is being used — and to identify areas for potential savings.

I found the dataset online through a data science community/forum. It was available for practice and non-commercial use, and I used it purely to learn Power BI and data storytelling. I focused on transforming and visualizing the data to build something that reflects real-world business use cases.

## 🔧 What I Did

- Cleaned and reshaped the dataset using **Power Query**
- Created new **calculated columns** and **DAX measures** to drive KPIs
- Designed an **interactive dashboard** with slicers, tooltips, and drill-down features
- Ensured that the report is easy to explore and understand, even for non-technical users

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to structure raw data efficiently in Power Query
- Writing and debugging **DAX** for custom logic
- Visual storytelling using charts, KPIs, and slicers
- Creating a clean, minimal layout that works across screen sizes

## 🏆 Highlights of the Dashboard

- Trend analysis over time
- Device/system-level filtering with dynamic visuals
- Drill-down navigation to isolate root causes or spikes in usage
- Simple UI/UX for better readability and interaction

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query Editor**
- **DAX**
- **CSV file format (for data input)**

## 📁 Notes

This project was self-initiated as a way to improve my Power BI skills. While the data wasn’t proprietary or real-time, all the data processing, design choices, and dashboard logic were created by me from scratch.
